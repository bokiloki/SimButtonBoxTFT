# SimButtonBoxTFT
Arduino Racing Simulator Button Box

This project utilizes the Arduino Joystick library found here: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary.

Other libraries included are Adafruit: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library and https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TouchScreen and https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library


Using a Arduino Leonardo and a TFT touch Display I created a simple GUI to controll the Joystick library.

I hope someone finds it useful.

Any comments are greatly apreciated.
